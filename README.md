# Predicting-CTCF-cell-type-active-binding-sites-in-human-genome

Due to the large size of the complete list of CTCF binding sites and the processed data matrix used for training the classifiers, we were unable to upload these datasets to GitHub. However, we have provided instructions in the GitHub repository indicating that interested readers can request access to these data by contacting us via email(22246013@mail.imu.edu.cn).
